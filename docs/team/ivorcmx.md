### Project: NUScheduler

NUScheduler is a desktop app for Year 1 Computing students to assist with more efficient management of tasks and contacts, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, NUScheduler can schedule your tasks faster than traditional GUI apps.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Implemented `DeleteTask` command.
    * What it does: Allow the user to delete a particular task based on its ID in the Tasklist
