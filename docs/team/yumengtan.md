### Project: NUScheduler
NUScheduler is a desktop app for Year 1 Computing students to assist with more efficient management of tasks and contacts,
optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you can type fast, NUScheduler can schedule your tasks faster than traditional GUI apps.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Implemented `FindTask` command.
    * What it does: Allow the user to find matching tasks in task list based on keyword/

    * `FindTaskCommand`
