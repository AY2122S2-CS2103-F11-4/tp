### Project: NUScheduler
NUScheduler is a desktop app for Year 1 Computing students to assist with more efficient management of tasks and contacts,
optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you can type fast, NUScheduler can schedule your tasks faster than traditional GUI apps.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Implemented `AddTask` command.
    * What it does: Allow the user to add a task to the application with description and deadline (optional)
    * Justification: Our target audience is year 1 computing students. It helps them to keep track of their assignments
  and any other daily tasks.
    * **Classes created**:
      * `AddTaskCommand`
      * `AddTaskCommandParser`
      * `TaskList`
      * `Task`
    * **Tests written**:
      * `AddTaskCommandTest`
    * **Additional info**:
      * `Task` and `TaskList` classes are created to capture the information of tasks and store them as an `ArrayList` in
      `ModelManager`.
